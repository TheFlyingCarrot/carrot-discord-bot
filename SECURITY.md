## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

- Report the security issue to the Node.js Security WG through the [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for ecosystem modules on npm, or to [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

Note that time-frame and processes are subject to each programâ€™s own policy.

- Report the security issue to the project maintainers directly.

Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to acknowledge your contributions.
